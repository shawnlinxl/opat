    """ Aggregate trade data to create day by date holdings information

    Arguments:
        trades {DataFrame} -- trade records
            trades should have the following columns:
            - tradeday: this is the index of the dataframe of trade dates
            - ticker: the name/ticker of the product being traded
            - quantity: number of contracts bought/sold
            - action: whether this is buy/sell

    Keyword Arguments:
        start_date {string} -- None will use the first trade date as the first holding date. Otherwise,
        only create holdings after the respective start_date. (default: {None})
        end_date {string} -- None will use the current date as the final holding date. (default: {None})
    
    Returns:
